# Proof of Transcend SDK

This directory contains Python and Javascript SDKs for Proof of Transcend. These SDKs are an abstraction layer built for improved developer experience on top of Aevos's [verified inference](/verified-inference/) architecture.

## Quickstart
To get started with building verifieable AI agents go to Proof of Transcend [SDK quickstart docs](https://aevos.gitbook.io/aevos).


## High Level Overview
1. Your AI Agent calls an LLM API for inference using the SDK.

2. Our back-end runs inside TEEs - fully encrypted hardware enclaves.

3. TEE back-end makes the calls to LLM APIs and returns the responses with verifiable proofs. 

4. We also provide an SDK to easily verify inferences and retrieve a list of previous messages to show as logs.
